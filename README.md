+  ExpiMap learns to map cells into biologically understandable components representing known ‘gene programs’. The activity of each cell for a gene program is learned while simultaneously refining them and learning de novo programs.

+  ExpiMap compares favourably to existing methods while bringing an additional layer of interpretability to integrative single-cell analysis. It is applicable to analyse single-cell perturbation responses in different tissues and species and resolve responses of patients who have coronavirus disease 2019 to different treatments across cell types.
